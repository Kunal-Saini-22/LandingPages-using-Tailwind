# Let's-learn-Tailwind-CSS

### Introduction : What is Tailwind CSS ?

- It's a utility first CSS framework that uses predefined classes called utility classes to add styling to the present elements.
- The utility classes are itself added to the HTML element which we want to style just similar way we write inline CSS but this 
  time we use utility classes for doing that.
 
 ### Tailwind in comparison with Vanilla CSS 
 Definately the designing control and freedom offered by pure CSS can't be matched by either of frameworks but Tailwind also 
 provides freedom to add design to a very good extent and have its own advantages over the vanilla CSS like : 
 
- Faster UI designing
- Good readabiltiy and maintainability of css code
    
 ### Tailwind in comparison with BOOTSTRAP
 Bootsrap works realy well when you don't much focus on the designing of UI portion and need elements to just arrange and test the
 woking moreover a similar sense of styling is used  in bootstrap so a very less freedom is given to modify or redesign.
